## Introdution

Writing is not easy and nobody wants to waste time inserting tables and figures in conventional text editors. Therefore, the use of tools that allow automation in text files such as latex and rmarkdown is essential. The learning curve is not as fast as in a conventional text editor, but believe me, it will be worth it.

The purpose of this work is just to show you how to make a manuscript using rmarkdown. It is important to remember that data does not speak for itself and needs context.

## Material and Methods

We used data from CESTES data base to understand a bit more about species and the environment. 

The data represent an ecological community of `r ncol(comm)` species distributed in `r nrow(comm)` sites. At each site, the following measurements were taken: `r paste(names(envir), collapse = ", ")`.



## Results

Variation of environmental variables across sites is something. 


```{r table}
envir_tbl$mean_std <- paste(envir_tbl$mean, envir_tbl$std, sep = " ± ")
knitr::kable(envir_tbl[, c("mean", "mean_std")], 
             format = "simple",
             caption = "Table 1. Mean and standard deviation of environmental metrics across sites", 
             col.names = c("Variable", "Mean (± std)"), 
             align = c("cc"))
```


Most species are rare and a few species are very abundant. 


```{r sad, fig.cap = "Figure 1. Species abundance distribution in XXX", out.width=500}
knitr::include_graphics("../figs/02_species_abundance.png")
```



## Discussion

It is time to synthesize your results and relate your findings with theory.
